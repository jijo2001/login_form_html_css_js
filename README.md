Designing the User Interface (UI)
The login form typically includes fields for the user to input their credentials (username and password). You create this form using front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. Key elements include:

Username/Email Input Field: A text box for users to input their username or email.
Password Field: A secure input field where the password is hidden from view.
Submit Button: A button that submits the form to the server when clicked.
2. Handling Form Submission
When the user submits their credentials, the form sends the data (username and password) to the server. The data can be sent via an HTTP request, usually as a POST request, which hides sensitive information like the password from the URL.

3. Backend Logic
The server receives the data and checks if the provided credentials are correct:

User Lookup: The server looks up the username or email in the database.
Password Verification: Once the user is found, the password provided by the user is compared against the hashed password stored in the database.
Passwords are generally hashed (converted into a fixed-length, irreversible string) for security. The stored hashed password is matched against the hashed version of the entered password.
